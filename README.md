# OBJECTIVE 🏅

The challenge of the project was based on the creation of a web application that offers the search for GIFs, using asynchronous Javascript (for the management of the asynchronous code I used ASYNC/AWAIT). I made use of hooks like "UseState" for state management, and "UseEffect" for component lifecycle control.
In addition, the application can be switched from "day mode" to "night mode" by using "template literals" that allow you to input logic for the CSS.
